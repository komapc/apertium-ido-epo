## Words to Verify for Stage 1 (Bilingual Mappings)

### Already in monolingual dictionary (need bilingual mappings):

Checking from analysis: @kom, @ye, @ed, @ank, @ca, @ta, etc.

Let me search the official dictionary...

### Searching official Ido-English dictionary:

**Checking "kom":**
- Searching in provided dictionary... NOT FOUND as standalone word
- May be variant or error - SKIP

**Checking "ye":**
- Found in dictionary: **ye** {prep.} at, on, in _(time or place; indefinite)_
- âœ… VERIFIED - "ye" is a valid Ido preposition

**Checking "ed":**

- Need to verify if "ed" exists separately - CHECKING

**Checking "anke":**
- Searching... need to find in dictionary
