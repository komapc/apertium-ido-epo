# Git Workflow - CRITICAL RULE

## NEVER Push Directly to Main/Master

**ALWAYS create a pull request for ANY changes.**

### Correct Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# 3. Push to feature branch
git push origin feature/descriptive-name

# 4. Create pull request on GitHub
# DO NOT use: git push origin main
# DO NOT use: git push origin master
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/add-coordination-rules`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/dictionary-cleanup`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/consolidate-copula`)
- `docs/` - Documentation updates (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)
- `test/` - Test additions (e.g., `test/add-pronoun-cases`)

### Exception

Only push to main if explicitly told "this is an emergency hotfix that must go directly to main" - and even then, prefer a PR.
