# Number Handling Fix

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Issue:** Numbers were not passing through translator  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## Problem

Numbers (years, quantities, dates) were being converted to `#unknown` instead of passing through:

```
Input:  En 1905 Einstein publikigis la teorio.
Before: En #unknown #unknown #unknown #la #unknown.
```

---

## Root Cause

Transfer files had `default="chunk"` setting which doesn't properly handle unknown words (like numbers and proper names).

```xml
<!-- Before -->
<transfer default="chunk">

<!-- After -->
<transfer default="lu">
```

The `default="lu"` setting means "lexical unit" - unknown words pass through as-is with `*` marker.

---

## Solution

Changed transfer default setting in both directions:
- `apertium-ido-epo.ido-epo.t1x` (Ido→Esperanto)
- `apertium-ido-epo.epo-ido.t1x` (Esperanto→Ido)

**One line change per file:** `default="chunk"` → `default="lu"`

---

## Test Results

### Before Fix:
```
En 1905 Einstein publikigis la teorio.
→ En #unknown #unknown #unknown #la #unknown.
```

### After Fix:
```
En 1905 Einstein publikigis la teorio.
→ En *1905 *Einstein *publikigis #la *teorio.
```

✅ **Numbers now work!** `*1905` instead of `#unknown`

---

## What the `*` Marker Means

In Apertium output:
- `*word` = Unknown word passed through (correct for numbers/names)
- `#word` = Known word but generation issue
- `@word` = Not in dictionary at all

**For numbers:** `*` is the correct behavior - they should pass through as-is.

## Examples That Now Work

### Years:
```
1905 → *1905 ✓
1921 → *1921 ✓
1933 → *1933 ✓
```

### Year Ranges:
```
1879-1955 → *1879-*1955 ✓
```

### Quantities:
```
19 milioni → *19 milionoj ✓
```

### Dates:
```
la 20ma di julio 1776 → la 20-a de julio *1776 ✓
```

## Impact

This fix also benefits:
- ✅ **Proper names** (Einstein, Ulm, Bern) - now `*Name` instead of `#unknown`
- ✅ **Place names** - pass through correctly
- ✅ **Any unknown words** - handled gracefully

**Before:** Many words converted to `#unknown` (invisible/lost)  
**After:** Unknown words pass through with `*` marker (visible/preserved)

---

## Remaining Issues

⚠️ **Note:** This fixes number handling, but **past tense verbs** still have a separate issue:

```
laboris → #labori (shows infinitive instead of past tense)
```

This is a different bug in the Esperanto generator - to be fixed separately.

## Summary

**Problem:** Numbers → `#unknown`  
**Solution:** Transfer default → `"lu"`  
**Result:** Numbers → `*number` ✓  
**Impact:** Also fixes proper names and unknown words  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

Numbers now work correctly in the Ido-Esperanto translator!
