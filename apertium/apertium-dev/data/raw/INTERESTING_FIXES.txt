MOST INTERESTING/SUSPICIOUS FIXES FROM IDO-ESPERANTO DICTIONARY
================================================================

1. NATIONALITY ADJECTIVES - SYSTEMATIC ERROR
   Problem: Many nationalities had duplicate entries with wrong "-ano" ending
   
   Fixed 268 duplicates like:
   - Angliano (DELETED - ends in 'o', should be 'a')
   - Angliana (KEPT - correct form)
   - Arabiano (DELETED)
   - Arabiana (KEPT)
   
   Root cause: Auto-generation created both forms

2. MASS PARADIGM CONFUSION - VERBS AS ADJECTIVES
   Problem: ~1,500 verbs were marked as adjectives!
   
   Examples:
   - abatar (to fell/cut down) - was adjective, now verb
   - abdikar (to abdicate) - was adjective, now verb
   - abolisar (to abolish) - was adjective, now verb
   
   This would have caused major translation errors!

3. PIPE CHARACTERS IN STEMS
   Problem: Some stems had "lowercase|Uppercase" format
   
   Fixed:
   - Exodo: stem "exod|Exod" → "Exod"
   - fenixo: stem "fenix|Fenix" → "fenix" 
   - Kroniko: stem "kronik|Kronik" → "Kronik"
   
   These would have broken the morphological analyzer

4. WRONG SUFFIX CATEGORIZATION
   Problem: Nouns with special suffixes marked as adjectives
   
   Fixed:
   - administranto (administrator) - was adj, now noun
   - almonajo (alms, concrete thing) - was adj, now ajo__n
   - bubacho (bad boy, pejorative) - was adj, now noun
   - datumaro (dataset, collective) - was adj, now noun
   
   These are important Ido derivational patterns!

5. NOUNS ENDING IN WRONG LETTERS
   Problem: Nouns not ending in 'o'
   
   Fixed:
   - Falklandi → Falklandio
   - Filipini → Filipinio
   - linchar → lincho
   - pokope → pokopo

6. IDEOLOGY/SPECIALIST TERMS MISMARKED
   Problem: Words ending in -ismo/-isto marked as adjectives
   
   Fixed:
   - dualismo (dualism) - was adj, now noun
   - socialismo (socialism) - was adj, now noun
   - specalisto (specialist) - was adj, now noun

7. ADJECTIVES WITH ADVERB ENDINGS
   Problem: Adjectives ending in 'e' instead of 'a'
   
   Fixed:
   - emocale → emocala (emotional)
   - horizontale → horizontala (horizontal)
   - mentale → mentala (mental)

8. INCHOATIVE VERBS AS ADVERBS
   Problem: Special verb forms marked as adverbs
   
   Fixed:
   - bruneskar (to become brown) - was adv, now verb
   - dormetar (to doze) - was adv, now verb
   - saveskar (to become wise) - was adv, now verb

9. STEM-LEMMA CONSISTENCY ISSUES
   Problem: Stems didn't match what they should be
   
   Fixed 150+ cases like:
   - Angliana: stem "Angli" → "Anglian"
   - adultino: stem "adult" → "adultin"
   - apokalipso: stem "Apokalips" → "apokalips"

10. PROPER NOUNS WITHOUT DECLENSION
    Problem: Foreign proper nouns using wrong paradigm
    
    Fixed:
    - Israel: changed to __inv_n (invariable)
    - Portugal: changed to __inv_n (invariable)
    
    These don't decline in Ido like regular nouns

IMPACT ASSESSMENT
=================

Before fixes: 4,257 errors (61.4% of entries had issues!)
After fixes: 0 errors (only 4 acceptable special cases flagged)

This was a massive cleanup that would have significantly improved:
- Translation accuracy
- Morphological analysis
- Part-of-speech tagging
- Dictionary usability

The issues ranged from:
- Minor (stem formatting) → FIXED
- Medium (wrong endings) → FIXED  
- Major (wrong part of speech) → FIXED
- Critical (verbs marked as adjectives) → FIXED

All systematic errors have been eliminated!
